[![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.com/GabrielDVpereira/NODE-CLEAN-API.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.com/GabrielDVpereira/NODE-CLEAN-API)

this is a practice project that implemets knowledges taken from the Node clean Archtecture course from Rodrigo Manguinho

## Config
In order to standard the development, a few dependencies are used:

- Husky: hooks to run lint and test before each commit
- lint-staged: It's usually used with husky to run commands only on staged files
- jest: test library to write integration and unit tests 
- typescript: Superset of javascrit to include types and newest javascrit features in our code.
- eslint: Linting to ensure code pattern. 
- jest-mongodb: generates a in memory mongodb for tests
- Express: build a http server
- Sucrase: Parse TS to JS (server hosts and browsers only understands js)
-fast-glob: file manipulation
